# Autonomous-vehicle-navigation
This project leverages semantic segmentation using **DeepLabv3** to enhance autonomous vehicle navigation in complex Indian traffic scenarios. Using the **Indian Driving Dataset (IDD)**, the system identifies road features such as vehicles, pedestrians, lanes, and road signs, enabling safer and smarter driving decisions in real-time.

 Key Features

* Semantic Segmentation with DeepLabv3: Pixel-wise classification of road scenes for precise environment understanding.
* Tailored to Indian Roads: Trained on IDD to handle unstructured, diverse, and dynamic traffic conditions common in India.
* Supports Autonomous Decision-Making: Enables obstacle detection and path planning for safe navigation.
* End-to-End Pipeline: Includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualized predictions.

Technologies Used

* Python
* DeepLabv3 (pre-trained and fine-tuned models)
* OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks
* Indian Driving Dataset (IDD)

Outcome

* Successfully segmented key road components with high accuracy.
* Demonstrated the feasibility of using semantic segmentation in real-time autonomous driving applications on Indian roads.
